Accurately forecasting solar irradiance and temperature is essential for optimizing solar energy systems, improving environmental monitoring, and supporting climate-responsive technologies. Variations in these parameters throughout the day and across different weather conditions can significantly influence the performance and planning of solar applications.

This project aims to develop a supervised machine learning model that predicts solar irradiance and temperature based on features such as:
Time of day (AM/PM format),
Ambient temperature, and other available sensor data collected under real-world outdoor conditions.

By leveraging data collected over multiple sessions, the model will learn to identify patterns and relationships in environmental conditions that influence solar behavior. The outcome is a predictive tool that can estimate future irradiance and temperature values, contributing to better decision-making in solar system design, energy forecasting, and environmental analysis.

The dataset used for this project was manually collected by the project team over several days and at different times of the day. Measurements were taken using field sensors and instruments, capturing values for:

Time (including both AM and PM entries),
Ambient temperature,
Solar irradiance, and corresponding values under various real-world environmental conditions.

Each recording session is documented as a separate sheet or section within the dataset to reflect the specific day and time of collection
